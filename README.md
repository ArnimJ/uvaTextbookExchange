##Project 7
- Project 7 should work as expected. 
- After you run docker-compose up, please go to the website and view some of the listings using multiple accounts
- You can then run ./spark.sh to start the spark job that will run every 3 minutes. 
- The recommendation service needs at least three users to view an item before it will produce output and add it to table
- The recommendation is in a table format underneath each item listing
